# angular-firebase-projects

This is a sample app that lets user (prospective group member) enter their information for review to join the group. 

The form conducts validations for all of their information, and if it is valid, pushes the person and their information to my Firebase database.

The firebase database is being hosted by Firebase Hosting.
